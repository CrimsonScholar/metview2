Hello!

Thank you for the nice assessment test, it was fun!
Before we continue I wanted to note a couple things.

1. Please see `NOTES.md`, it explains any design decisions or things
   I encountered during this test.
2. All other files, including this one, I will be "in character".
   Please read this as though it were a real git repository.
3. If I need to "break character", I will note it with a "XXX:" prefix.

That's all for now!
